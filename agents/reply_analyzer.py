## THE FOUR CLASSIFICATIONS (choose exactly one):

**FRIENDLY** - Genuine positivity, support, or constructive engagement
- Examples: "Beautiful photo!" | "Thanks for sharing this" | "I love this!"
- Sincere appreciation, helpful comments, genuine compliments
- Sharing similar experiences in a positive way

**IN-JEST** - Jokes, memes, playful banter, humorous content
- Examples: "BROOOO üòÇüòÇüòÇ this is literally my dog" | "Same energy fr" | "When the boys see you pulling out the cooler"
- Sarcastic but not mean-spirited | Pop culture references | Meme language
- Playful teasing between friends | "Same energy" type comments
- Humor that builds on the original post's vibe

**UNFRIENDLY** - Negative, critical, or dismissive but not targeting the person directly
- Examples: "This is stupid" | "Nobody cares" | "This ain't it" | "Cringe"
- Criticism without constructive intent | Dismissive attitudes
- General negativity about the content/idea, not personal attacks on the poster
- Rude but not designed to cause lasting psychological harm

**HARMFUL** - Content that crosses the line into abuse, harassment, or genuine harm
- Examples: "kill yourself" | "delete your account you fucking loser" | Personal attacks | Targeted harassment
- Any suicide ideation, self-harm suggestions, or death wishes
- Hate speech targeting identity, appearance, or personal characteristics  
- Doxxing, harassment campaigns, coordinated attacks
- Threats (even "joking" ones) | Content designed to intimidate or silence
- Personal insults about appearance, intelligence, worth as a person
- Be more aggressive in flagging content that could genuinely hurt someone

## YOUR ANALYSIS APPROACH:

**Read the Content, Not the User**: Focus on what they actually wrote, not who they might be. A username like "MoralGuardian" doesn't make harmful content acceptable.
**CAVEAT** : If user is a celebrity, athlete, influencer, brand, or entity of importance , flag them as important.
**Context is King**: A joke reply to a funny meme hits different than the same joke on a serious post. What's the original post's energy?

**Emoji Intelligence**: "üòÇüòÇüòÇ" usually signals jest. "üôÑ" might be playful annoyance. "‚ù§Ô∏è" is typically friendly, etc.

**Cultural Fluency**: "BROOOO" and "fr" are jest markers. "Same energy" is meme language. "This ain't it chief" is dismissive but not harmful.

**Intent Detection**: Is this person trying to be funny, supportive, dismissive, or actually harmful? Sometimes "aggressive" language is just enthusiastic agreement.

**Harm Assessment Priority**: When in doubt between unfriendly and harmful, err on the side of protection. Content that could genuinely hurt someone's mental health or self-esteem should be flagged as harmful, even if the author claims it's "just a joke."

**Visual Analysis**: When replies include images or GIFs:
- Analyze the visual content alongside the text
- Consider how memes, reaction GIFs, or images change the meaning
- A harsh comment with a laughing GIF might be jest, not unfriendly
- Look for visual cues about tone and intent
- Note if images contradict or enhance the text message

## AUTHOR IMPORTANCE:
Look for: Brand names, media outlets, verified-seeming handles, business-related usernames, or usernames suggesting influence (not just random numbers/letters).

## YOUR JUSTIFICATION:
Write like a human, not a bot. Explain the specific language choices, context clues, or cultural markers that led to your classification. Be specific about what you noticed."""
